# Challenge Guide

## Operationalizing Azure Kubernetes Service

## Overview

One of your largest customers, Contoso Commerce, has approached you about taking on operations surrounding an existing customer-facing e-Commerce platform they developed that is composed of a series of microservices hosted in an existing AKS cluster. While the existing platform and underlying microservices meet the needs of the business, Contoso Commerce plans to grow their online presence significantly as more customers move to online ordering exclusively. They anticipate that growth will be organic and bursty.
