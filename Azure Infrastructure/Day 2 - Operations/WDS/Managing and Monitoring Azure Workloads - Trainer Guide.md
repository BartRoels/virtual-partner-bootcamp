# Trainer information

Thank you for taking time to support the whiteboard design sessions as a trainer!

## Role of the trainer

An amazing trainer:

-   Creates a safe environment in which learning can take place.

-   Stimulates the participant's thinking.

-   Involves the participant in the learning process.

-   Manages the learning process (on time, on topic, and adjusting to benefit participants).

-   Ties it all together for the participant.

-   Provides insight and experience to the learning process.

-   Effectively leads the whiteboard design session discussion.

-   Monitors quality and appropriateness of participant deliverables.

-   Effectively leads the feedback process.

## Whiteboard design session flow 

Each whiteboard design session uses the following flow:

**Step 1: Review the customer case study (15 minutes)**

Outcome 

Analyze your customer's needs.

-   Customer's background, situation, needs and technical requirements

-   Potential issues, objectives and blockers

**Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution (60 minutes)**

Outcome 

Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

-   Determine your target customer audience.

-   Determine customer's business needs to address your solution.

-   Design and diagram your solution.

-   Prepare to present your solution.

**Step 3: Present the solution (30 minutes)**

Outcome

Present solution to your customer.

-   Present solution

-   Respond to customer objections

-   Receive feedback

**Wrap-up (15 minutes)**

-   Review preferred solution

## Before the whiteboard design session: How to prepare

Before conducting your first whiteboard design session:

-   Read the Student guide (including the case study) and Trainer guide.

-   Become familiar with all key points and activities.

-   Plan the point you want to stress, which questions you want to drive, transitions, and be ready to answer questions.

-   Prior to the whiteboard design session, discuss the case study to pick up more ideas.

-   Make notes for later.

## During the whiteboard design session: Tips for an effective whiteboard design session

**Refer to the Trainer guide** to stay on track and observe the timings.

**Do not expect to memorize every detail** of the whiteboard design session.

When participants are doing activities, you can **look ahead to refresh your memory**.

-   **Adjust activity and whiteboard design session pace** as needed to allow time for presenting, feedback, and sharing.

-   **Add examples, points, and stories** from your own experience. Think about stories you can share that help you make your points clearly and effectively.

-   **Consider creating a "parking lot"** to record issues or questions raised that are outside the scope of the whiteboard design session or can be answered later. Decide how you will address these issues, so you can acknowledge them without being derailed by them.

***Have fun**! Encourage participants to have fun and share!*

**Involve your participants.** Talk and share your knowledge but always involve your participants, even while you are the one speaking.

**Ask questions** and get them to share to fully involve your group in the learning process.

**Ask first**, whenever possible. Before launching into a topic, learn your audience's opinions about it and experiences with it. Asking first enables you to assess their level of knowledge and experience and leaves them more open to what you are presenting.

**Wait for responses**. If you ask a question such as, "What is your experience with (fill in the blank)?" then wait. Do not be afraid of a little silence. If you leap into the silence, your participants will feel you are not serious about involving them and will become passive. Give participants a chance to think, and if no one answers, patiently ask again. You will usually get a response.

# Managing and Monitoring Azure Workloads - Whiteboard Design Session Student Guide

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this whiteboard design session, you will look at how to design monitoring and management solutions in Azure. Your focus will be on a partner Managed Service Provider scenario, where management must be provided at scale across a large number of customers.

At the end of the workshop, you will be better able to design and use Azure monitoring and management tools, including Azure Monitor Workbooks, Log Analytics, Azure Alerts, and Azure Automation. You will also understand how to deploy these technologies across a large portfolio of customers using a variety of automation technologies. You will also better understand the challenges involved in managing Azure solutions at scale.

## Step 1: Review the customer case study 

**Outcome** 

Analyze your customer’s needs.

Timeframe: 15 minutes 

Directions: With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips. 

1.  Meet your table participants and trainer. 

2.  Read all of the directions for steps 1–3 in the student guide. 

3.  As a table team, review the following customer case study.
 
### Customer background

Contoso Cloud Services (CCS) is a Microsoft Partner providing a broad portfolio of cloud-focused IT solutions to its customers.

CCS was founded in Atlanta in 1998, originally as Contoso IT Services. The original business successfully rode the dot-com bubble, creating and hosting web sites as customers established their on-line presence. The hosting side of the business grew into a substantial managed services business, with CCS building hosting facilities in Atlanta, New York, Denver and San Jose.

The CEO of CCS, Jack Walsh, was quick to recognize that the dawn of the cloud era would transform his industry. In 2015 he re-branded the company as Contoso Cloud Services and set in place a new business strategy offering cloud-based and hybrid cloud services. Given CCS’s long history as a Microsoft partner, Microsoft Azure was the natural choice as preferred public cloud provider.

CCS has built a broad base of around 600 managed services customers, mostly medium-sized and large businesses. More recently CCS has also acquired a handful of enterprise customers, reflecting the company’s ongoing growth and success.

### Technical background

The current CCS portfolio of managed customer applications comprises:
-   Legacy on-premises applications hosted in CCS’s four datacenters. The strategy is to migrate these solutions to cloud-based alternatives as hardware ages, and eventually to reduce the datacentre footprint from 4 sites to 2.
-   Hybrid solutions, using an 200Mbps ExpressRoute connection supplied by the existing CCS WAN provider
-   Cloud-only customer solutions. These comprise both IaaS solutions (mostly arising from lift-and-shift migrations) and a smaller but growing portfolio of modernized PaaS-based applications.

CCS is a direct CSP. CSP Azure subscriptions are used by most customers. However, some customers are using pay-as-you-go subscriptions which they acquired before engaging CCS, and their enterprise customers use EA subscriptions.

### Current situation

As head of Cloud Operations for Contoso Cloud Services, you are responsible for keeping all your in-house and customer managed services healthy, secure and available 100% of the time. As your cloud business grows, you need to scale your operations activities accordingly—but you can only use the resources your already have.

Currently, your team manages each customer and application individually--so as the number of customers and applications grows, so does your workload. Pretty soon, the team aren't going to be able to cope. The only solution is to improve your teams' efficiency.

Your challenge is to redesign your operations processes for horizontal scale. You need to create efficient processes that enable your team to deliver core operations scenarios—such as health alerts, dashboards, backup and patching—across your growing customer base.

### Customer needs 

1.	**Subscription access** Access to customer subscriptions uses a combination of CSP ‘Act On Behalf Of’ (AOBO) and AAD B2B Collaboration. Managing access as team members change is a challenge, and some enterprise customers are disgruntled at the overhead on their side of managing changes to B2B guest accounts. CCS need a solution that provides access to customer subscriptions without undue customer overhead, full transparency, and fine-grained access control.

2.	**Backup configuration and monitoring** A key part of CCS’s offerings is backup management. CCS uses Azure Backup for backup of both on-premises and cloud-based servers and databases. Backup monitoring and management is a growing time sink for the operations team. In a recent incident it was found that backup jobs had been failing on one customer application for the past 2 months. Alerts had failed due to a missing diagnostics logging configuration. No one knows how many other applications are similarly affected. CCS need a scalable and reliable backup monitoring solution.

3.	**Patch management** CCS are using System Center for patch management for both on-premises and cloud-based servers. Their goal is to deprecate System Center in favour of a cloud-based alternative. This must provide comprehensive coverage across their entire server estate (on-premises/cloud, Linux/Windows).

4.	**VM and server monitoring** CCS are managing a large number of VMs across their customer subscriptions. VM diagnostics and monitoring has been configured for each application over time, using a variety of approaches. These include Azure metrics, diagnostics storage accounts, and Log Analytics. CCS would like to settle on a unified approach to server monitoring across their entire estate, including on-premises machines.

5.  **Automation of manual tasks** Occasionally, CCS need to make configuration changes to on-premises servers or to Azure-based applications. A diverse and unpredictable range of activities is involved. Examples from the past 6 months include changing the endpoint for a file share, installing a new anti-malware product, rotating passwords and auditing database accounts. These tasks are currently carried out manually. CCS are seeking a general-purpose solution to enable these manual tasks to be automated.

6.  **PaaS monitoring** CCS are experienced at monitoring IaaS-based workloads. They are less experienced with PaaS workloads, and are unsure what level of monitoring they need to implement vs what is taken care of by the cloud provider. As the number of managed PaaS applications increases, they need to define best practice patterns for SQL Database and Web App monitoring and alerts.

### Customer objections 

1.  Cost is a concern. As well as being cost-efficient, CCS prefer solutions that keep any costs associated with managing a customer solution within the customer subscription, rather than centralizing management costs into a CCS subscription and then having to apportion across customers.

2.  CCS are finding that their new enterprise customers are more demanding regarding security and compliance. How can CCS demonstrate their services meet enterprise standards for secure operations?

## Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution

**Outcome** 

Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format. 

Timeframe: 60 minutes

**Design**

Directions: With all participants in your group, respond to the following questions on a flip chart or (virtual) white board.

1.  **Subscription access** Design a solution to allow the CCS operations team with access to customer subscriptions.
    - The solution should support role-based access control, so the customer has visibility and control over which permissions are granted to CCS.
    - The solution should support user groups, so changes to the CCS operations team do not require customer involvement.
    - There solution should support all subscription types (PAYG, CSP, EA, etc).

    Are there any Azure features which are not compatible with your proposed solution?

2.  **Backup configuration and monitoring** How can CCS monitor Azure Backup health? Design a solution that enables:
    - Visibility into backup health across all customers
    - Identify VMs without backup enabled
    - Raise alerts upon backup failure, across all customers
    - Ensure backup monitoring is correctly consistently applied to all Recovery Services Vaults

    Does your solution scale to the number of customers and subscriptions managed by CCS?

3.  **Patch management** What alternatives to System Center does Azure offer for patch management? Design an approach that offers:
    - Support for on-premises and cloud-based servers
    - Support for both Windows Server and Linux
    - Automatic on-boarding for Azure virtual machines and VM scale sets

    How does your solution scale patch management across the CCS customer base?

4.  **VM and server monitoring** Design a solution for monitoring Azure VMs and on-premises servers. Your solution should support:
    - Streamlined onboarding of all Azure VMs and selected on-premises servers
    - Support for dashboards and alerts based on both metrics and logs. 
    - Customer billing according to usage
    - Compliance with Enterprise customer security requirements that all logs remain within their subscription boundary

    How can you ensure your solution is deployed consistently across all CCS customers, for data gathering, alert configuration, and reporting?

    Can your solution deliver flexible and highly configurable dashboards of key performance data?
    
    Can your dashboards show data aggregated across the CCS customer base? What limitations apply?

5.  **Automation of manual tasks** How can CCS automate their manual configuration tasks? Your solution must support:
    - Automation of Azure resource configuration tasks (e.g. VM resize, disk encryption, network changes)
    - Automation of operations for Azure VMs (e.g. rotating passwords, installing or uninstalling software, auditing permissions)
    - Automation of operations for on-premises servers

    How can you deploy automation at scale across the CCS customer base?

    How can you review the success or failure of each automation task, on each resource?

    Automating common tasks is a substantial investment in IP. How can you protect the confidentiality of this investment?

6.  **PaaS monitoring** Design a solution for monitoring PaaS services, in particular Azure SQL Database and Azure Web Apps. Your solution should support:
    - Gathering key metrics and log data for alerting and investigation of incidents
    - Configuration of alerts in the event of performance degradation (e.g. increased latency), errors, or critical events.

    What can you do to make your monitoring more representative of the end-user experience?

    A customer raises a support ticket claiming their application is 'slow'. How can your monitoring help investigate the cause?


**Prepare**

Directions: With all participants at your table: 

1.  Identify any customer needs that are not addressed with the proposed solution.

2.  Identify the benefits of your solution.

3.  Determine how you will respond to the customer’s objections.

## Step 3: Present the solution

**Outcome**
 
Present a solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

Timeframe: 30 minutes

**Presentation** 

Directions:
1.  Pair with another table.

2.  One table is the Microsoft team and the other table is the customer.

3.  The Microsoft team presents their proposed solution to the customer.

4.  The customer makes one of the objections from the list of objections.

5.  The Microsoft team responds to the objection.

6.  The customer team gives feedback to the Microsoft team. 

7.  Tables switch roles and repeat Steps 2–6.

##  Wrap-up 

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions: Tables reconvene with the larger group to hear the facilitator/SME share the preferred solution for the case study.

# Building a resilient IaaS architecture whiteboard design session trainer guide

## Step 1: Review the customer case study

-   Check in with your table participants to introduce yourself as the trainer.

-   Ask, "What questions do you have about the customer case study?"

-   Briefly review the steps and timeframes of the whiteboard design session.

-   Ready, set, go! Let the table participants begin.


## Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution

-   Check in with your tables to ensure that they are transitioning from step to step on time.

-   Provide some feedback on their responses to the business needs and design.

    -   Try asking questions first that will lead the participants to discover the answers on their own.
    
-   Provide feedback for their responses to the customer's objections.

    -   Try asking questions first that will lead the participants to discover the answers on their own.

## Step 3: Present the solution

-   Determine which table will be paired with your table before Step 3 begins.

-   For the first round, assign one table as the Microsoft team and the other table as the customer.

-   Have the Microsoft team present their solution to the customer team.

    -   Have the customer team provide one objection for the Microsoft team to respond to.
    
    -   The presentation and objections should be no longer than 15 minutes.
    
    -   If needed, the trainer may also provide feedback.

## Wrap-up

   -   Have the table participants reconvene with the larger session group to hear the facilitator/SME share the following preferred solution.

## Preferred solution


1.  **Subscription access** Design a solution to allow the CCS operations team with access to customer subscriptions.
    - The solution should support role-based access control, so the customer has visibility and control over which permissions are granted to CCS.
    - The solution should support user groups, so changes to the CCS operations team do not require customer involvement.
    - There solution should support all subscription types (PAYG, CSP, EA, etc).

    Are there any Azure features which are not compatible with your proposed solution?

*Solution*

The CSP Act-On-Behalf-Of approach to partner access to customer subscriptions has the following drawbacks:
-  It only works for CSP subscriptions. It does not work for other subscription types (PAYG, EA) which are used by some CCS cusotmers
-  It only grants 'Owner' permissions, which some customers find excessive, creating a security objection for the customer
-  Each admin is granted access to all CSP subscriptions. There is no ability to fine tune which operations team staff have access to which subscriptions

The AAD B2B Collaboration approach (also known as guest users) has the following drawbacks:
- It does not support user groups, and therefore requires each operations team member to be individually enrolled by each customer
- It requires the operations staff to switch context between each customer's directory. There is no 'all up' capability for reporting across customers.

Azure Lighthouse offers significant advantages over both of these approaches, and is the recommended solution.

With Azure Lighthouse, subscriptions or resource groups from the customer tenant are 'projected' into the partner tenant. Operations staff within the partner authenticate to the partner tenant, from where they are able to access and manage the projected resources as if they were local to the partner tenant.

Permissions are granted as part of the delegation, are fully visible to the customer, and cannot be changed later by the partner.  Permissions can be granted to AAD groups, rather than individual users, allowing the partner to manage group membership without customer impact. Permissions can also be granted to service principals, enabling partner automation also to access customer subscriptions.

There are two ways to enrol a customer with a partner using Azure Lighthouse:
- Using a Resource Manager Template
- Using the Azure Marketplace

In the template-based approach, the customer uses a template to deploy a resource of type `Microsoft.ManagedServices/registrationDefinitions` into their subscription. The resource properties specify which partner is to be granted access (AAD TenantID), which permissions will be granted to the partner (Azure roles), and which users or groups will receive those permissions (AAD ObjectIDs). This information should be obtained from the partner beforehand - in practice, the partner will prepare the template for the customer to deploy.

The registrationDefinition creates the customer/partner relationship. The customer can then delegate either the entire subscription or individual resource groups by creating a resource of type `Microsoft.ManagedServices/registrationAssignments` at the corresponding scope. The registration assignment has a single property, referencing the registration definition. This resource can also be created using a template, or can be managed via the Azure Portal (via the 'Service Providers' experience).

Alternatively, the partner can publish their managed service offering via the Azure Marketplace. To do this, they will need to enrol in the 'Commercial Marketplace' program via Partner Center. This requires a Silver or Gold 'Cloud Platform' competency. The partner will then create a 'Managed Service' offering, specifying all the details included in the registration definition as described above (tenantID, roles, objectIDs) in addition to a description of their service. The customer can then enrol with the partner through this Marketplace offer, rather than by deploying a template. (This enrolment also creates a `Microsoft.ManagedServices/registrationDefinitions` resource in the customer subscription, so the two approaches work the same way.)


1.  **Backup configuration and monitoring** How can CCS monitor Azure Backup health? Design a solution that enables:
    - Visibility into backup health across all customers
    - Identify VMs without backup enabled
    - Raise alerts upon backup failure, across all customers
    - Ensure backup monitoring is correctly consistently applied to all Recovery Services Vaults

    Does your solution scale to the number of customers and subscriptions managed by CCS?

*Solution*

Azure Backup has recently delivered two new monitoring solutions (as preview): Backup Explorer and Backup Reports.

Backup Explorer provides a near-real-time dashboard of backup health. It is powered by the Azure Resource Graph, and hence does not require any additional diagnostics configuration, storage accounts, or Log Analytics workspaces. It is always available, for all Recovery Services Vaults. It only supports data from the past 7 days.

Backup Reports provide deeper analysis of backup performance, including storage space consumed and historical trends. This solution is built on Log Analytics. It requires the Recovery Services Vault to be configured to send diagnostic logs to the Log Analytics workspace, and data can take up to 24 hours to surface in the reports.

Both solutions are built using Azure Monitor Workbooks, and offer aggregated cross-tenant views across subscriptions delegated using Azure Lighthouse. There are no subscription limits with Backup Explorer; Backup Reports inherit the Log Analytics limit of 100 subscriptions per query, and hence a single report cannot span the entire CCS customer base.

For CCS, their dashboard should be based on Backup Explorer. This offers a near real-time view across all customer subscriptions. Failed backup items and jobs can be quickly located, and the dashboard can also be used as a launch pad to drill down for deeper investigation. For more information, see [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/monitor-azure-backup-with-backup-explorer].

Backup alerts can be delivered in two ways: alerts configured directly within the Recovery Services Vault (email only) or alerts based on Log Analytics queries and Azure Monitor. The built-in alerts have several limitations (for example, not supporting alerts from on-premises backups using Microsoft Azure Backup Server or System Center Data Protection Manager). For this reason, Log Analytics/Azure Monitor alerts should be used. These have the additional advantage of supporting Action Groups.

Log-based alerts should be configured based on the Azure Backup 'V2' diagnostic data schema. Note that V1 schema is planned for deprecation.

This requires that each Recovery Services Vault is configured to send diagnostic data to a Log Analytics workspace. A workspace in the customer subscription should be used, for billing and isolation (compliance) purposes. Diagnostic logging can be configured using Azure Policy (see '\[Preview\]: Deploy Diagnostic Settings for Recovery Services Vault to Log Analytics workspace for resource specific categories.') This policy supports remediation and can therefore also be used to configure existing recovery services vaults.

A separate policy assignment will be needed in each customer subscription. In addition, the alerts will also need to be configured per vault. This process should be automated (for example, using a Resource Manager template or Blueprint) so it can be applied consistently at scale across the CCS customer base.


3.  **Patch management** What alternatives to System Center does Azure offer for patch management? Design an approach that offers:
    - Support for on-premises and cloud-based servers
    - Support for both Windows Server and Linux
    - Automatic on-boarding for Azure virtual machines and VM scale sets

    How does your solution scale patch management across the CCS customer base?
