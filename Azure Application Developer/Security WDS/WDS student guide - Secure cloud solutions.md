# Secure Cloud Solution Whiteboard Design Session Student Guide

## Abstract and Learning Objectives

In this whiteboard design session, you will learn how to implement different components of a secure cloud solution that integrates Active Directory, security policies that cover network security groups (NSGs) Shared Access Signatures (SAS), certificates and other application secrets. In this session you will learn secrets management and managed identities.

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Step 1: Review the Customer Case Study
=======
- Identity: Authorization and Access for B2C and B2B scenarios
- Secure Azure PaaS resources such as App Services web apps, Azure SQL from public endpoints
- Secure your secrets,passwords, and application configuration data from code repositories to production
- Use Azure Policies and Role Based Access Control (RBAC).

At the end of this whiteboard design session, you will improve your knowledge of Authorization and access of developer resources. You will improve your knowledge of data encryption at rest and in transit. Learn how to keep solution secrets outside of source control. Learn about secret management and abstract key rotation away from applications and their developers. You will be able to better protect applications in the cloud from external threats by guarding public endpoints. Learn to give your applications access to secrets so development teams won't need to keep track or even know the actual secrets.

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Customer Situation
The renewable energy industry is growing fast!   

Contoso Solar Inc (Contoso) is a US Domestic commercial and residential solar installation and solar technology supply firm headquartered in the Pacific NorthWest, Unitest States.    

Established 2004, by founders Susan Johnson (CEO) and Darren Cross (CFO), Contoso have almost tripled in size, and have taken on a lot of new projects that even take them from a US Domestic only operation, to an international operation with the the closing of a lucrative project from neighboring British Columbia, Canada.   This has been a long and exciting road that involved a 36 month app-modernization effort coupled with a recent lift and shift to the cloud using Azure.  This was followed again by an 18 month re-design of their key applications to take advantage of serverless deployments to take advantage of swifter time to market to accomodate the massive grwoth enjoyed industry wide.  

Now that the overall cost to install solar has dropped by almost 70% and charging and conversion efficiency has increased, the business case for solar is very hard to ignore with overall unit installation price dropping - in many cases, with components converging on commodity status.  

Contoso currently has three satellite offices, each supporting installation, fulfullment, and distribution teams:  Portland, OR, Seattle, WA, and Austin, TX.   And, as a result of their success in the industry as well as achieving GDPR/CCPA compliance including a SOC 3 certification, they will be opening a new office in Vancouver, BC to tackle the new commercial business acquired in BC which is the installation of solar for a number of provincial buildings including schools, and transit stations.   

Susan Johnson (CEO) and Darren Cross (CFO) recognize the power of Azure public cloud. 
Contoso now has most of their key line of business applications, data storage, and analysis operations on Azure.   They use M365 and each satellite office has a small on-prem compute resource used to run specific scanning and installation kitting gear.  These domains are federated using AD Connect up to the primary AAD in Aure.  Contoso currently supports direct inbound and outbound data integration with established first tier solar technology manufacturers and component suppliers located globally as well as direct integration with shippers and payment providers. 

According to Chief Information Officer (CIO) Jessica Sams, Contoso's main concern is providing **robust application security** for it's own suppliers and customers while also providing an easy online experience for them. Contoso currently manages authentication via Azure Active Directory but wants to reconfigure to support a more robust solution for 3 major user experiences:

- **B2B** - Solar Manufacturer/Providers, including professional technical contributors such as: architectural, engineering, and regulatory/legal advisors from state and local entities.   One key workflow partner of this group is Contoso's own Commercial and Residential professional installer teams as there is heavy cross-team, cross-corporate interaction during execution of project installations.  

- **B2C** - DYI Consumers purchasing components and services directly - either wholesale or retail, and/or opting in persistent account access enabling consumer access to extended offerings provided by Contoso Consumer Services including pre- and post- sales technical support, blog access, and access to technical events sponsored by the industry

- **OPS** - Internal employee groups such as C-Suite, HR, IT, Fulfillment, Installation Teams, Partner and Consumer Services, Sales and Marketing

With these use cases and the addtion of new infrastructure, locations, and employees, Contoso needs a solution that will provide reliable authentication but in addition, they require robust account management functionality, as well as the ability to secure and audit application configuration, and integration events. 

In particular, Suppliers accessing Contoso's Supplier Workflow and APIs should only have access to resources granted to those accounts.   One Supplier should not be able to interact with allocated resources of another supplier.   

Customers purchasing from the retail website should not be able to access wholesale prices, but an OPS Contoso Sales Account Manager should be able to see both retail and wholesale information for both B2B and B2C scenarios. 

This requires a system for access and authentication that can be centrally controlled by the Contoso OPS IT Team.

In addition to Authentication and Access management (Identity), Contoso wants to ensure that their backend infrastructure use as much of the Azure backbone as possible to include direct integrations with their cloud-based CRM and ERP systems.   And of course, any APIs and Web Applications need to be secure as well, with no application secrets stored in any config or application settings so they can be managed by the security team in accordance with their InfoSec Policy. 

**Contoso IT Security Team** 

The security team is lead by Jason Ming, VP of IT Operations, who reports to Jessica Sams (CIO/DPO), and manages all operational aspects of IT infrastructure including security. 

The security team is a small cross-functional unit of DevOps-aware individuals from other teams who participate by focusing on improving full-stack security.  This is a new approach, and timely since Contoso now has executive sponsorship to invest in the next push to improve the current system architecture.   

This team manages all security aspects for the applications and users at the company, from database access all the way down to card-key access readers, and as such they want to utilize Azure to simplify and reduce management overhead for Contoso's operations to ensure a lean, mean, secure configuration.

**Contoso Development Team** 

Contoso's Development Team is headed by David Stone, Lead System Integrations and Software Engineer 
Under David's leadership, the Contoso Develpment team Team have settled on Azure DevOps as their primary CI/CD platform and the run a tight ship with a clean backlog, using a Git-Flow   

Applications are deployed using Azure DevOps Pipelines with minimal 3rd party tool interaction with the exception of some common open source testing and verification/risk management libraries.  

Their typical sprint is 7 days with trunk releases (major, minor, and patch) in a blue-green configuration every Thursday.  

### Customer Requirements
The following requirements are a result of over a year of hard work assessing Contoso's IT security requirements in order to maintain compliance with certain certifications they need to work with global providers and provide for their customers, as well as transacting with first-tier payment providers and certifcation organizations. 

Fulfiliing these requirements using robust, repeatable capabilities is essential to Contoso's continued growth and success.   Failure in any one of these areas can jeaopardize the firm's ability to maintain their current level of compliance    

**Provide Unified Identity Management Throughout the Organization â Including Partners and Consumers**
Contoso has moved most of its primary applications and workflow into the cloud and uses M365 E5 licensing for their operations.   

**Existing Active Directory Domains**
There are 3 small local legacy AD V1 domains at each of the 3 satellite offices which are what is left of the old federated domain model after their primary move to the cloud.   Most employees interact through AAD via the M365 tenant, but some will log into machines within the installation warehouses where compute is used drive some PLC controllers for installation kitting and automation, but those machines are simple Windows Server Standard 2016 installs and few in number.  Each machine group is secured on domain by Windows Security Group membership, and the on-prem domains are already federated via Azure AD Connect to the parent M365 tenant.    DNS for www.contososolar.com is wired to the M365 tenant.

**Existing Azure Subscriptions**
Two additional Azure Subscriptions have trusted relationships with that same M365 tenant, one subscription for development, testing and another subscription for staging and production releases of their enterprise Applications and APIs.    

**Other Integrations**
Contoso uses Dynamics for their entire front operations including CRM and ERP functions as well as running an e-commerce purchase path directly through Dynamics.    

**Data Storage**
All of their operations, analytics and reporting datastores are on Azure SQL Database:

In![image info](./images/ADDeployment.png)

Given the environment, there are three valid authentication scenarios:  
- **B2B** - Partner Manufacturer/Suppliers should be able authenticate on invitation to Contoso's identity management using their work credentials via a guest configuration with Contoso's M365 tenant.   This will allow partners to authenticate and be authorized to interact with Contoso's application platforms as required either through direct Web or API interaction or via M365 UX, or perhaps even via Azure AD Application Proxy for older apps supporting SAML only.  

- **B2C** - DIY Retail Consumers should be able to use the ecommerce purchase path to purchase solar components with an anonymous cart purchase path.   Or they can create a persistent account with Contoso, using an email as username or using a social login from a valid Identity Provider, and save payment methods and view order status and order history along with sharing other social details if they desire.   This method gives them access to pre- and post- sales technical support as well as event and blog content.  

- **OPS** - Existing and New internal employees should be able to login with their assigned Active Directory Work Account from any valid secure location on any approved device.  Optionally this authentication flow may require multi-factor authorization (MFA).   Once authenticated, the user will experience single sign-on (SSO) behavior across enterprise applications and endpoints until they fully log out.

**Goal:** Provide an enterprise-ready solution to unify user and service account authentication, authorization, and management (provisioning).   This goal is essentially the foundational core of all the other requirements as it defines the identity management for users, LOB applications, and custom applications such as web apps, apis, service apps.  
=======
### Customer situation

Contoso Plumbing Supply (Contoso) is a family owned wholesale plumbing supply company founded in Minneapolis, Minnesota that has been around for over 40 years. In that time, the company has thrived by embracing new business technology and practices, a mindset passed on to the current CEO and granddaughter [NAME HERE] of the company founder.

In the 1990's, Contoso created a data center in the back of their main warehouse to handle customer orders and supply chain management. Over the years Contoso has modernized their data center to keep up with demand and it has worked well for them, allowing Contoso to acquire two plumbing supply companies that were not as fortunate, and a regional retail plumbing store.

Contoso now has warehouse locations in Pennsylvania, Seattle, and Nevada and retail locations in the surrounding states. In order to serve these locations, Contoso is adopting cloud technology to provide supply chain services and direct to consumer ordering. Additionally, Contoso wants to migrate all the functionality to the cloud and retire their small local data center.

Contoso's main concern is providing **secure connectivity** for it's own suppliers and customers while also providing an easy online experience for them. Contoso currently manages authentication with a private Identity server and wants to move to a more robust solution.

With the addition of a lot of new employees, Contoso needs a solution that will provide authentication to the system as well as handle permissions and access to specific data. In particular, customers that purchase from the retail website should not be able to access the wholesale prices, but a sales rep at the store location should be able to see that information in order to make on the spot deals. This requires a system for access and authentication that can be centrally controlled by the management teams.

In addition to Authentication and Access management (Identity), Contoso wants to see secure network architecture for the various locations. The web applications need to be secure as well, with no application secrets stored in any config or application settings so they can be managed by the security team only. Contoso wants the security team to control all the certificates, keys, and tokens for the applications and users at the company.

### Customer needs

1. Identity Login: Retail users (the public) should be able to create an account using a social login and save payment details and view past orders. New employees should be able to login with single sign-on and require multi-factor authorization.
2. Identity Roles: Employees should have access only to the information they need to do their job.
3. Data encryption: All data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
4. Network Security: Data needs to be consistent, which means information from one location and others needs to sync, and do so securely.
5. Developers should not have access to production application secrets.
6. The Application will need to authenticate with Azure services such as Key Vault.
7. Client applications will need to authenticate - Contoso needs a strategy for access tokens and authentication.

*This solution should be a combination of securing **SQL server** using **TDE** and **always encrypted** setting up network security on the **VNET** using **NSGs**. Additionally, the application secrets should be in **Azure Key Vault** and the connections should all be **SSL** and **tls**. The application should require log-in through AAD or social using Microsoft Identity v2. The data needs to be consistent so back up and replication syncing should be included. **Cosmos DB** is another possible solution either to replace or in addition to SQL server. Any storage accounts or other types of access can use **shared access signatures** with policies or some other form of **revokable token** for access. security.*

*The solution will be deployed in multiple regions and use Traffic Manager with WAF on the front-end. The solutions will use auto scale with app services for the web sites based on traffic and cpu. For the fast performance in ordering, users should use some form of CQRS and messaging (Table Queues or Azure Service Bus) and the order subscriber to the queue should query the queue length to autoscale.*

**Provide Authorization Using Role Based Access Control for Custom Applications**
As per Contoso's Infosec and Data Handling Policies, there is an active Segregation of Duties (SOD) Matrix that defines a list of account roles and security groups within the company structure.   Employees should have access only to the information they need to perform their duties.  This requirement implies use of Role-based Access Control (RBAC) within the enterprise to match the SOD matrix.   
OPS employees are allocated to roles and groups based on Employee Job Description and this will determine access to key resources, systems, and data.  

Listed below is a simple role classification for Contoso: 
- **Business Admin** â C-Suite, VPs
- **HR Admin** - HR Team 
- **Sales** - Sales and Marketing Teams
- **System Admin** â Configuration Team members, mapped to Azure Subscription Contributors.
- **Security Admin** â Security Team members, mapped to Azure Security Owners. 
- **Developer** â Development Team members 
- **Developer Contractor** â Development contractors 
- **Operations** â Office Operations, Installer Engineers, Fulfillment, and Technical Support 
- **External Partners** â B2B all external supplier and professional service partners interacting with Contoso applications 
- **External Consumer** â B2C all external consumers who have created accounts with Contoso for the Extended Payment, Service, and Technical Advisory Experience Contoso provides. 

**Goal:** Using the unified strategy you come up with above, apply the concept of Least Privilege and RBAC to configure roles to ensure that every user and service principle has the right level of permissions to the right principal, at the right time to execute â nothing more, nothing less.  Within the secure workflow of custom applications, apply RBAC checks based on roles found in access claims from the unified identity strategy to make decisions within the custom application workflow as to what actions the authenticated principal can take.   This secures endpoints that users and services can integrate with and ensures that custom applications are secured using the same unified strategy as the rest of the organization.

**Ensure Data Encryption - AT ALL TIMES (at rest and in motion)**
As Per Contoso's Infosec and Data Handling Policies, data will be encrypted at rest and in motion throughout the application stack, regardless of location and status and this includes during application synchronization (raw data file upload/download, application data synchronization, and API transactions).  

**Goal:**  Ensure all data within the organization is encrypted at all times and reduce complexity of application encryption by using pre-built middleware to encrypt/decrypt on the fly. 

**Provide Data and Resource Access Control based on RBAC and Identity**
As Per Contoso's Infosec and Data Handling Policies, data and resource access controls will be applied to ensure the right data is available to the right people at the right time.  
Access is controlled by role scoping, as well as filtering by robust unique identifier criteria.   
Contoso also needs to audit certain activities and the audit process is tied to resources as well as roles.  

Listed below is a simple **data classification** of Contoso secure data: 

- **Business Critical** - Client Architectural, Engineering, Requirements, or Legal and Regulatory documents uploaded by architectural firms or by state and local regulatory entities 
- **Business Critical** - ERP, Transactional Data related to Wholesale and Retail Transactions, and Service Process data classified as **Business Critical ** by Contoso
- **Business Critical** - CRM, Sales Pipeline/Biz-Dev, Supplier, and Consultative Contributor, and Persistent Retail Customer profile data
- **Mission Critical** - Post process Analysis, Poduct Definitions, Product Catalog
- **PII** - Employee HR data to include data that is considered PII by GDPR/CCPA standards

<<<<<<< HEAD
**Goal:** Using RBAC role definitions, lock down access to data and resources within the applications to the appropriate roles.   Ensure access to data and resources are controlled based on permissions applied to roles.   This will simplify security management and reduce risk of improper access across the organization.  

**Provide Authorization Using Role Based Access Control for Custom Applications**
Custom applications should verify access and capabilities for user and service principals using the same unified identity strategy the rest of the organization uses where possible.    Using the same strategy means access to the same roles defined in RBAC and this means a global role-based approach can be applied to the organization which reduces management complexity and overhead, as well as making the management of roles and assignment more centralized.    
=======
Directions:  With all participants at your table, answer the following questions and list the answers on a flip chart:

1. Who should you present this solution to? Who is your target customer audience? Who are the decision makers?

2. What customer business needs do you need to address with your solution?
>>>>>>> parent of 1b7b8fb... added deck and edits to student guide

**Goal:** Within the secure workflow of custom applications, apply RBAC checks based on roles found in access claims from the unified identity strategy to make decisions within the custom application workflow as to what actions the authenticated principal can take.   This secures endpoints that users and services can integrate with and ensures that custom applications are secured using the same unified strategy as the rest of the organization.

<<<<<<< HEAD
**Provide Robust Application Deployment to Improve Stability and Security**
For deployment, application reliability and security can be improved by using consistent development, verification, and deployment practices.  
Using a dedicated, secure pipeline build tool-chain as the official deployment source will reduce the probability of injecting security risks into Production. 

**Goal:** Use consistent deployment processes and practices to ensure stable and secure deployments.  

### Customer Objections

1. We are concerned that the  addition of other AAD instances to support B2C and B2B guests will require us to recreate all of our accounts and reassign permissions
2. We are worried about applying RBAC because in the past it has been hard to ensure people get the right access
3. The Development Team is concerned that further constraining releases will slow down development 
4. The Development Team is also worried about the depth of refactoring required to ensure custom apps can verify actions to roles 

### Key Design Considerations

According to David Stone, Lead System Integrations and Software Engineer, Contoso operates mostly in North American West Coast. This means that for now, performance for multiple regions takes a back seat to the more emergent application and integdration security  concerns.  The IT Group has implemented minimal cloud-based HADR, but since Contoso is growing, their IT Group will revisit these topics in the near future after the security upfit is complete.  

Nearly all of the custom applications Contoso have deployed are ASP.NET Core Web Apps and APIs or .NET Core Daemon Apps.  This is a result of a massive refactoring and tool-chain consolitation campaign started last year, uplifting their custom applications from a jungle of legacy tools and languages to a common tool-chain and language set.   This effort resulted in more predictable delivery due to reduced complexity, faster development, and greatly reduced time to market. 

All front-end APIs and Web Apps are deployed to auto-scaled app service plans.   In the near future, the Application Architecture Team is considering converting to a CQRS architecture to address scale concerns for upcoming growth by using an event/messaging, or pub-sub design pattern. 

The overall design should provide a wholistic cloud security strategy extending security for existing integrations as well as setting the stage for current and future development.  
=======

In terms of Secure Cloud Application requirements, a few things are clear:  
- Following Principle of Least Privilege, Developers should not have direct code-level access to production application secrets
- Applications need to be configured to authenticate with Azure services such as Azure SQL Database, and Azure Key Vault
- Client applications will need to authenticate discreet classes of users using a unified security approach - Contoso needs a unified strategy for authentication and authorization

<<<<<<< HEAD
**NOTE**
=======
1. How will you ensure the application scales and can expand into new regions?

2. How will you ensure the solution will scale appropriately under heavy traffic?
>>>>>>> parent of 1b7b8fb... added deck and edits to student guide

Locking down a Secure Cloud Application Strategy is the primary concern right now however, Contoso is growing - fast - so consideration for scale and performance should be included during design.
